      <p>
        Sydney is the capital of the State of New South Wales, Australia. It is Australia’s oldest and largest city with a population of over 5.33 million.

Sydney was visited by the British in 1770 when Captain James Cook and Botanist Joseph Banks sailed the Endeavor into Botany Bay. It was the site of the 1st European colony in 1788 when convict-bearing ships of the First Fleet came from England to set up the colony of New South Wales.

Aboriginal sites and engravings can still be seen in Sydney from the original occupiers, the Eora tribe. The city also has an anglo-mediterranean style and a significant Chinese and Asian influence

<h3>History</h3>

  <p>Sydney is named after Lord Sydney, who was British home secretary when Captain Arthur Phillip and the First Fleet arrived in January 1788. In a letter, Phillip described the colony in Sydney Cove as having “the finest harbour in the world” in which “a thousand sail of the line may ride in the most perfect security”.
  </p>
  Aboriginal people have a much longer connection with the harbour, dating back at least 50,000 years before Phillip chose Sydney Cove as the site of Australia’s first penal colony. At the time more than 1,500 Aborigines were living on the foreshore.

The colony’s early years were harsh. After four governors and a military revolt, known as the Rum Rebellion, governor Lachlan Macquarie was put in charge. He restored order and charted a new course for NSW, Australia’s first state, as a free society.

Macquarie was a great builder and visionary. Rivers and lakes, a bank, a university, even a dictionary, are named after him. By the 1830s, Sydney was a busy commercial seaport exporting wool to Europe.

Transportation of convicts from Britain ended in 1840. Gold fever struck in the 1850s; Edward Hammond Hargraves is credited with finding the first payable goldfields near Bathurst, in Country NSW, in February 1851. By the 1870s, Australia’s population had trebled.

<p>Immigration has transformed Sydney into one of the world’s most ethnically diverse cities. More than 180 nationalities call it home. You’ll discover more of Sydney’s past at museums and on heritage and cultural tours, and at the State Library of NSW on Macquarie Street.
