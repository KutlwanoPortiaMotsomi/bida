          <h1>Australia Day</h1>

          <p>
            Australia Day is all about celebrating outdoors with many events taking place all over Sydney. The most notable starting with the Ferrython where the green and yellow catamarans race through Sydney Harbour to the finish line under the Harbour Bridge, to the aerial flyover by the Royal Australian Air Force Fast Jets, the many beach goers along Sydney’s coast line, as well as the many burning BBQ’s in the backyard. There is so much to see across Sydney on this day including the finishing fireworks over Darling Harbour.

<h3>Vivid</h3>
<p>
  Locals and tourists all love this May to June event but the hardest part is picking which area of Sydney has the best view to see the most. From the Opera House, Circular Quay, the Harbour Bridge, over into Darling Harbour and throughout the city to Town Hall, this light, music and ideas festival brings life into the Sydney cooler nights. To see the art of light move its way over beautiful Sydney, see it all in one go from the top in a Sydney helicopter night tour.
