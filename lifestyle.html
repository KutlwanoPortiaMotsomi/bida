              While Melbourne has the reputation for coolness and culture, Sydney gives it a pretty good run for its money, and definitely has looks on its side. I would say Melbourne’s city centre is more café orientated than Sydney’s, with its cute little laneways such as Degraves, but once you get out into the Sydney suburbs you’ll find a plethora of stylish, individual coffee shops and restaurants to choose from.

              f there is one thing that shines in Sydney, apart from the skyscrapers, Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge at night, it is the abundance of beautiful beaches.

              While everyone and their dog has heard of Bondi Beach – there’s even a TV programme, Bondi Rescue, set there; a real-life Baywatch without the cleavage – and most people are familiar with Manly and Coogee, Sydney has much more to offer along its stunning coastline than these three beautiful but busy Sydney beaches. With over 100 beaches to choose from, any beach bum will be utterly spoilt living in Sydney.

<h3>Driving and Public Transport In Sydney</h3>
<p>
  Sydney has a large transport network of trains, buses and ferries, and passengers pay with a pre-paid Opal Card (like an Oyster Card in London), which you scan at the start and end of your journey. I’ve found prices to be fairly reasonable; a journey of 3-8km costs $3.50 on the bus, or $4.50 for a longer distance.</p>

<p>
  Hopping on a train for an extra couple of stops within the city centre after a bus ride in only adds on about $0.30 extra. Fares are also capped at $60 per week, and there’s unlimited transport on a Sunday for $2.80 – not just within the city but all the way out to the Blue Mountains or up to Newcastle! Check Opal fares in more detail on the Opal website.

The bad side of public transport in Sydney is the sparseness of the train line compared to the huge size of the city. Journeys often require a combination of trains and buses, which can be very slow. Ferries are more expensive but reward you with some very pretty views of the harbour. Not a bad commute at all!</p>

<h3>Daylight Hours In Sydney</h3>
<p>
  The variation of daylight hours between summer and winter is less extreme in Australia than in the UK, meaning you don’t get those long summer nights, but you also don’t get those horribly short winter days when the sun goes down before 4pm.

Being located in New South Wales, Sydney has daylight saving, giving you an extra hour of daylight in the summer evenings. It gets light around 5:30am and dark around 8:30pm in Sydney’s summertime, and light by 7am and dark by 5pm in the winter.
